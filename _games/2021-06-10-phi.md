Phi is a solo project I created for the Weekly Game Jam 204, and won 1st out of 31 entries.
For the project, I wanted to touch on all aspects of creating a small but unique platformer,
including programming physics, creating art assets, and composing music.

{% include gallery id="display"%}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/gameCaptures/phi/banner.png" alt="gameplay image" %}

Phi's character controller was created with a state machine inspired by Celeste's player controller. 
I used raycasting for collision detection to precisely interact with the umbrella and implement ledge correction.

{% include gallery id="mechanics"%}

To emphasize her bounciness, I added procedural squash and stretch and particle effects to both Phi and the umbrella.
