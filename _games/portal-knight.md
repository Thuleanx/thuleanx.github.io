Portal Knight is a 3D isometric hack and slash game created as a submission for 
[A Game By Its Cover Jam](https://itch.io/jam/a-game-by-its-cover-2022/entries) 
over the month of November 2022. 
I was in charge of programming and audio implementation and design, and 
[Allison](https://allisonkyeh.com/) was the artist.

Throughout the course of development, I implemented enemy AI pathfinding with NavMesh, 
branching narrative with YarnSpinner, audio with FMOD, and UI polish with DoTween.
