I was a programmer and VFX artist on this semester long project involving a team of more than 20 artists and programmers. 
My main focus was on particle effects, shaders, UI implementation and polish, and audio implementation.

{% include gallery id="setup"%}

I started with the artists' sketches, recreated them in the engine using particle systems. 

{% include gallery id="overrideProgression" caption="Progression from artist's draft to effect implemented in game."%}

{% include embed-audio.html src="/assets/images/gameCaptures/override/override.mp3" %}{: .align-right}
I layered different sound assets using FMOD to create the sound effects. 
The pitches of repetitive sounds were modulated and I applied a lo-pass filter on the entire music channel when the player is hit for more of an impact.

For implementation of different UI elements, I made use of post processing, particle effects, and animating the text mesh to create dynamism in these otherwise static screens.
