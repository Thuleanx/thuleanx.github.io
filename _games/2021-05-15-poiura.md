Poiura was my entry to a 15 days narrative game jam with Dylan, a writer and audio designer. I was responsible for programming and art; Beyond programming the game's mechanics, I also focused on writing shaders, 
implementing particle effects, and integrating dialogue using Yarn Spinner.

We wanted a horror game where the player is not running away helplessly. 
I gave the main character an inaccurate blunderbuss that reloads very slowly. 
Knockback, screenshake, and particle effects were added to emphasize the gun's impact.

For the town and the dangerous red woods beyond it, I added lighting, particles, and a foliage shader to enhance the environment.

{% include gallery id="environment" layout="half"%}

To accommodate for transitioning between the roughly 20 scenes of the game, I created a scene handler system using Scriptable Objects, that grew into this graphical node-based mapper. 
This allowed me to create rooms and transitions in an environment similar to the Unity Animator window.

For the dialogue, I integrated Yarn Spinner to insert Dylan's script into the game. 
I used Yarn Spinner both as a dialogue tree and a programming language to trigger different world events and Unity Timelines.
