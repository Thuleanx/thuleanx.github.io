Enter is a 2D Puzzle Platformer for PC and Mac, developed in Unity.
You play as a mouse pointer with the ability to right-click and copy paste elements of the game world.
Your right-click window also serves as a physical object that can be used as platforms or roadblocks.

As Co-Lead Programmer and VFX Artist, I was responsible for 
designing, developing, and refactoring the game's systems,
helping other programmers get acquainted with Unity,
and implementing VFX.
