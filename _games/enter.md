Enter is a 2D Puzzle Platformer for PC and Mac, developed in Unity.
As Co-Lead Programmer and VFX Artist, I was responsible for architecturing, developing, and refractoring the game's 
systems and designing and implementing VFX.

I mainly worked on the scene management system, glitch effect for the virus enemy, beginning sequence, 
lazer interaction and other interactible objects.
I also worked closely with the Audio Designer to add SFX and adaptive music to the game, as well as mentored
programmers less familiar with Unity.
