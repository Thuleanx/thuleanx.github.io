Demigod daycare is an auto-battler game inspired by Super Auto Pets, developed in Unity and 
released on the Android + IOS Store.
You run a daycare of demigod babies, and must compete with other daycares to win the gods' favor.

As Lead Programmer, my main responsibility was designing and implementing core features 
such as the turn-based combat system, save system, and hub interactions.

I also filled in as VFX artist to implement procedural animations, particle systems, and UI tweening.
