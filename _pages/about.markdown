Hi. I'm An Nguyen / Thuleanx, a gameplay and graphics programmer.

I'm currently working at Heavy Iron Studios as a Game Programmer, helping studio clients with gameplay 
prototyping and performance optimization for PC and Quest.

I love turning programming into a tool for creative expression and interactive storytelling. 
I especially enjoy doing game jams, competitive programming, and occasionally dabble in pixel art.

Feel free to reach out to me at [thuleanx@tutanota.com](thuleanx@tutanota.com).
