Hi. I'm An Nguyen, a gameplay and graphics programmer.

I'm currently working at Heavy Iron Studios as a Game Programmer, 
doing prototyping, procedural generation, and performance optimization 
for PC and Quest.

I love making games as a tool for creative expression and interactive storytelling. 
I especially enjoy doing game jams, competitive programming, 
and occasionally dabble in pixel art and music.

Feel free to reach out to me at [thuleanx@tutanota.com](thuleanx@tutanota.com).
