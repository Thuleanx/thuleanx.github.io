Hi. I'm An Nguyen / Thuleanx, a gameplay and graphics programmer.

I love turning programming into a tool for creative expression and interactive storytelling. 
I especially enjoy doing game jams, where I get to explore aspects of computer graphics, audio integration, and tools creation.

Outside of games, I also do cryptography research, competitive programming, and occasionally dabble in pixel art.

I'm looking for full-time opportunities on cool game and graphics projects. Feel free to reach out to me at [thuleanx@tutanota.com](thuleanx@tutanota.com).
