Following this [1997 Siggraph course](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~baraff/sigcourse/) and [1999 paper](http://graphics.berkeley.edu/papers/Obrien-GMA-1999-08/Obrien-GMA-1999-08.pdf), 
I implemented realistic physics simulation over two weeks in C++ and OpenGL utilizing the Finite Element Method.

{% include gallery %}

The simulation takes in an input tetrahedral mesh from an obj file, and performs calculations for forces such as
gravity, stress, strain, and internal viscous damping. 

{% include gallery id="gallery2" %}

The program uses the RK4-5 iterative method to simulate each timestep and runs in realtime.
Collisions are discrete and involves pushing the tetrahedron away from the other object along the collision's normal vector.

{% include gallery id="gallery3" %}

When objects are not being deformed, we don't need to simulate them too precisely. 
I implemented adaptive stepsizing to adjust my timestep to ensure that the simulation uses the largest 
possible timestep while staying under an error threshold.
