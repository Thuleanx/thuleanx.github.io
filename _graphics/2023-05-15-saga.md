        - Continuous ellipsoid-triangle collision, optimized with bounding volume hierarchy

        - Navmesh and basic behaviour tree system for authoring AI

        - Shadow mapping for directional light with PCF

        - Post processing stack supporting bloom, fog, depth of field ,
        and color adjustments such as ACES tonemapping, contrast, saturation, and white balance

        - FMOD Studio integration with spatial audio and parameter adjustments for 
        adaptive audio

        - CPU-based Particle system for camera-facing quads and 3D meshes that accurately responds 
        to depth-based effects (fog / dof)

        - IMGUI integration

        - Engine documentation with Doxygen
