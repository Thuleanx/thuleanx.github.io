Realtime is my month-long project for Brown's computer graphics class. 
I implemented the rendering pipeline that loads and render a scene file with the GUI to interactively adjust the tesselation
parameters.
This project helped me learn a lot about rendering pipeline concepts and how post processing is done in a 3D realtime engine.

For lighting, I wrote a glsl shader following the phong lighting model, and supports up to 8 directional, point, and spot lights.
I additionally implemented optimization via distance-based Level of Detail, and post processing shaders (grayscale, sharpen, and screen space ambient occlusion).
