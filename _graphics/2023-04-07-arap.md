I spent a week implementing this [paper](https://igl.ethz.ch/projects/ARAP/arap_web.pdf) from the Eurgraphics Symposium on Geometry Processing in C++ and OpenGL.
The goal is to be able to transform meshes while keeping deformations as rigid (so as close to the original mesh) as possible.
Users can anchor certain vertices in place, and move others with the mesh responding to the changes in realtime.
