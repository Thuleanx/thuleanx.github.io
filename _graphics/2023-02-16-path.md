As a 2 week project in Brown's graduate graphics class, I implemented Path Tracing in C++ and Eigen. 
This method is physically accurate unlike a regular ray tracer, and involves tracing light paths from the camera and surfaces
to perform Monte-Carlo integration for a surface's luminescence.

{% include gallery %}

The program supports diffuse, glossy, mirrored, and refractive materials. 
Since path tracing is expensive, I optimized rendering time by I using OpenMP to 
parallelize parts of the computation as well as a Bounding Volume Hierarchy to speed up ray intersection.

{% include gallery id="gallery2" caption="Renders with 100 samples per pixel taking 5-10 seconds."%}

For lower variance in our light sampling, I splitted integrating for direct and indirect lighting. 
For direct, the sensible thing is to shoot rays directly at a random point on a randomly sampled light source, 
whereas for indirect lighting, we recursively trace paths. 
The result is a much smoother render with the same sample per pixel count.

For sampling light bounces, I sampled porpotional to the BRDF (Bidirectional reflectance distribution function) instead of uniformly over the hemisphere tangent to the surface.
This is essential to get good renders of specular materials.

Lastly, I threw in depth of field and attenuated the refracted light for more realistic looking renders.
